BoxFigs' Custom Tool Textures Guide
-------------------------------------------------


tools/toolsblockbullets2
	A variant of tools/toolsblockbullets that doesn't cut vis.
	NOTE: Team Fortess 2 already has this texture.

tools/toolseffect
	Use for
		env_bubbles
		env_embers
		func_dustcloud
		func_dustmotes
		func_precipitation
		func_smokevolume
	instead of tools/toolstrigger.

tools/toolsinvisible2
	A variant of tools/toolsinvisible that doesn't cut vis.

tools/toolsinvisiblebutton
	The only tool texture that actually has its own functionality: it makes brushes it's applied to non-solid. This is useful for making func_button and func_rot_button non-solid, as they lack the ability to be non-solid by other means. 

tools/toolsinvisibleladder2
	A variant of tools/toolsinvisibleladder that doesn't cut vis.

tools/toolsnodrawtransparent
	A variant of tools/toolsnodraw that is transparent. Because of this, it no longer seals maps. Useful for invisible, solid brush entities, where you would otherwise use the standard toolsnodraw.

tools/toolsphysicsclip
	Use for func_vphysics_clip instead of tools/toolstrigger.

tools/toolsvehicleclip
	Use for func_vehicleclip instead of tools/toolstrigger.

tools/toolsviscluster
	Use for func_viscluster instead of tools/toolstrigger.
